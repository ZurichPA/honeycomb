# honeycomb

honeycomb is a dplyr backend for Hive. honeycomb developed out of [dplyr.spark.hive](https://github.com/rzilla/dplyr.spark.hive), which served as the launching point from which honeycomb was built. 

honeycomb is focused only on Hive, and it was adapted for compatibility with dplyr v0.5.
