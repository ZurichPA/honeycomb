\usage{
\method{right_join}{tbl_Hive}(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE,
  suffix = c("_x", "_y"), ...)
}
\description{
join functions in honeycomb are just like those in dplyr as documented 
in \code{\link[dplyr]{join}}. The only difference is the default \code{suffix} 
values, which use underscores rather than dots for compatibility with Hive.
